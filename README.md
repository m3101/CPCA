# CPCA
A simple library for performing na√Øve Principal Component Analysis on .bmp images
This project uses my [bmpreader](https://github.com/m3101/bmpreader) library.

As of most (or every) project I've published so far, this has practice, learning and knowledge application as its only purposes. Please do not use in a production environment. There are much, much better libraries out there.

Note:

Many thanks to the University of Notre Dame for the X11 wrapper (I have two versions of it in my machine, one of which I modified a bit. I don't know which one I'm using here, but in both cases they saved me from many headaches). It's available [here](https://www3.nd.edu/~dthain/courses/cse20211/fall2013/gfx/).

## Building
