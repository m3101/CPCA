# CPCA
A simple library for performing na√Øve Principal Component Analysis on .bmp images
This project uses my [bmpreader](https://github.com/m3101/bmpreader) library.

As of most (or every) project I've published so far, this has practice, learning and knowledge application as its only purposes. Please do not use in a production environment. There are much, much better libraries out there.

## Building

Run `make`.
